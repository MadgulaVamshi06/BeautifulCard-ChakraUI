Component Organization:
The components were structured well, making it easy for users to understand the layout of the application.
Dividing UI into reusable components like Card, CardHeader, etc., facilitated maintenance and scalability.

Responsive Design:
Responsive design was implemented using Chakra UI's utility functions like templateColumns and boxSize.
This ensured the application looked good and worked well on various screen sizes and devices.

Semantic HTML:
Semantic elements (Heading, Text, Box) were effectively used to enhance accessibility and SEO.
Semantic HTML provided meaning to content for screen readers and search engines.

Styling with Chakra UI:
Chakra UI's styling props and components were utilized to maintain consistent styling across the app.
This reduced the need for custom CSS, maintaining a uniform design language.
